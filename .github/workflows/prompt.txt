2.  **File-by-File Review:** After the summary, provide a review for EACH file.
3.  **Collapsible Sections:** Each file's review MUST be enclosed in its own collapsible markdown section using `<details>` and `<summary>` tags.

### EXAMPLE OF THE REQUIRED FORMAT:

##ü§ñ AI Code Review Summary
This pull request introduces a new data fetching utility and its corresponding tests. The overall logic is sound, but there are a few opportunities for improvement in error handling and code clarity in the main utility file.

<details>
<summary><strong>üìù `src/utils/api.js`</strong></summary>

-   **Suggestion:** The error handling in `fetchData` could be more robust. Consider adding a `finally` block to ensure cleanup happens regardless of success or failure.
-   **Question:** The timeout is hardcoded at 5000ms. Should this be configurable via an argument?
-   **Nitpick:** The comment on line 23 is slightly out of date.
-   **Any other information you want to provide:**

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>üìù `tests/api.test.js`</strong></summary>

No issues found. The test cases are comprehensive and cover the primary success and failure scenarios.

</details>
