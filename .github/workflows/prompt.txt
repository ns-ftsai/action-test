### EXAMPLE OF THE REQUIRED FORMAT:

##ü§ñ AI Code Review Summary
This pull request introduces a new data fetching utility and its corresponding tests. The overall logic is sound, but there are a few opportunities for improvement in error handling and code clarity in the main utility file.

Brief introduction to the code changes in this file.

**Rating:** 7/10
**Code Quality:** Overall, the code is well writen, with clear and descriptive variable names. The use of `pytest.mark.parametrize` is also a good practice, as it allows for multiple test cases to be run with a single test function.
**Suggestion:** The error handling in `fetchData` could be more robust. Consider adding a `finally` block to ensure cleanup happens regardless of success or failure.
**Question:** The timeout is hardcoded at 5000ms. Should this be configurable via an argument?
**Nitpick:** The comment on line 23 is slightly out of date.
